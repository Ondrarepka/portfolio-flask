        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my portfolio website! Here you'll find information about my projects, skills, and experiences.</p>
        <h2>Short bio</h2>
        <p>My name is Ondřej Řepka. I was born in Mladá Boleslav, Czech Republic. I am designer by heart, but I always try to be the renaissance man in the digital age. So I can do a bit of coding (like this portfolio, or other things you can find in my projects page), a bit of graphics design, and a bit of writing.</p>
        <p>I studied Information science with main focus put to Service and Interface design and Ethics at Masaryk University in Brno, where I am currently located.</p>
        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Iterative Design & User Research (I adore user interviews and usability testing, but can also handle more quantitative methods)</li>
            <li>Graphic Design: Figma</li>
            <li>Writing: My strongest area is User-facing documentation and Technical writing</li>
            <li>Other: Linux system administration, Basic knowledge of Python and SQL</li>
            <li>Web Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) such as Vampire the Masquerade, FATE, or czech original Dračí Doupě. Most of the time I am the storyteller, because I love world-building and creating immersive experiences for players to explore.</p>
        <p>As most of guys my age, I love to play some video games from time to time, focusing on the ones with steeper learning curves, like Escape from Tarkov, Hunt: Showdown or ARC Raiders. And recently I picked up an old childhood hobby of mine, I play Magic the Gathering.</p>
        <p>I also love to play 12-string guitar and sing.</p>
